Austin Thompson is a second-year doctoral student in LSU's Department of Communication Sciences and Disorders with a research interest in speech science. Under the mentorship of Dr. Yunjung Kim, Austin’s research investigates the use of speech science to diagnose and treat individuals with dysarthria, a group of speech disorders caused by various neurological conditions (including Parkinson’s disease and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis). Specifically, he aims to investigate the relationship between perceptual, acoustic, and articulatory characteristics of speech to inform treatment for individuals with dysarthria. In other words, he explores the connection between how we speak and what we hear. In his spare time, Austin enjoys spending time with his dogs, tending to his houseplants, and watching scary movies.
